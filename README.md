### 🚀 About Me

I'm a fullstack developer with over **5 years of experience** building scalable, modern applications and integrating **AI-powered features** into real-world solutions. I’ve worked on everything from **microservices and cloud architectures** to **design systems and intelligent automation**, leading end-to-end development across teams and clients.

I’m passionate about creating tech that’s clean, modular, and future-proof — whether that means crafting efficient APIs, building UI components from scratch, or deploying services in production with confidence.

I also founded **Vanillabyte**, where I currently lead projects from concept to deployment.
